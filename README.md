ReadMe Marketplace <img align="right" width="25%" src="https://owlbertsio-resized.s3.amazonaws.com/Blocks.psd.full.png" />
===

Welcome to the Marketplace, where you can find pre-made, interactive MDX components that you can use to customize your ReadMe docs! Browse through [the `components/` directory][components], or [contribute](#contributing) a component by opening a PR.

### Using a Component

At the moment, this is a copy-and-paste dealio. See a component you want to use? Just copy and paste the raw MDX syntax in to a new component from your project's content management admin. Now you can access it from the slash menu in any of your docs. (You can also upload a folder full of MDX `components/` if you're using our new bidirectional git syncing workflow!)

Learn more about ReadMe's MDX features [here][mdx docs]!

### Contributing

Have a cool idea for a component that you think could be useful to the wider ReadMe community? We're accepting contributions to this repo; just open up a PR with your new MDX component and we'll do our best to review it and get back to you. And if you have any questions, just open an issue.
