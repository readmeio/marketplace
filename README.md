ReadMe Marketplace <img align="right" width="25%" src="https://owlbertsio-resized.s3.amazonaws.com/Blocks.psd.full.png" />
===

Welcome to the Marketplace, where you can find pre-made, interactive MDX components that you can use to customize your ReadMe docs! Browse through [the `components/` directory][components], or [contribute](#contributing) a component by opening a pull request.

### Using a Component

At the moment, this is a copy-and-paste dealio. See a component you want to use? Just copy and paste the raw MDX syntax in to a new component from your project's content management admin. Now you can access it from the slash menu in any of your docs. (You can also upload a folder full of MDX `components/` if you're using our new bidirectional git syncing workflow!)

Learn more about ReadMe's MDX features [here][mdx docs]!

### Some of our favs

If you're looking on where to start, check these out!

 * 📊 **[`<Compatibility>`](./components/Compatibility)**: Show what plans a feature is available for, or explain what user roles have access to it.
 * 🏞️ **[`<SnapSlider>`](./components/SnapSlider)**: Let users scroll through a handful of images, rather than having to pick just one!
 * 👩🏻‍💻 **[`<Terminal>`](./components/Terminal)**: A faux terminal that shows input and output, as well makes it easy to copy each command.
 * 👆 **[`<KeyPress>`](./components/KeyPress)**: Show some special content if the user hits a key-combo of your choice.
 * 🛠️ **[`<ExampleComponent>`](./components/ExampleComponent)**: If you're looking to build your own and need a simple example component, this is a great place to start!

### Contributing

Have a cool idea for a component that you think could be useful to the wider ReadMe community? We're accepting contributions to this repo; just open up a PR with your new MDX component and we'll do our best to review it and get back to you. And if you have any questions, just open an issue.
