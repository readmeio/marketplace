# `ToggleList`

## Overview

This component allows you to create a list of items where each item's content
can be toggled opened or closed. This can be useful for gradually introducing
content. For example maybe you want to tuck away details that might overwhelm
the reader if displayed all at once, or maybe you want to hide the punchline of
a joke! 

## Usage

There are two components that get used together, `ToggleList` and
`ToggleListItem`: 
- `ToggleList` is the wrapper around all of your list items and
can optionally accept any of the same props as a `ul` element.
- `ToggleListItem` is a single item in the list, that accepts a `title` to display
next to the toggle button and `children` that are shown or hidden based on the
toggled state. It also can optionally accept any of the same props as a `li`
element. 

```jsx
<ToggleList>
  <ToggleListItem title="What type of books do owls like to read?">
    Hoooo-dunnits ðŸ”Ž
  </ToggleListItem>
  <ToggleListItem title="Whatâ€™s an owlâ€™s favorite drink?">
    Hoot beer ðŸ¥¤
  </ToggleListItem>
</ToggleList>
```
